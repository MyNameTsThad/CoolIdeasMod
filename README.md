# Cool Ideas Mod
---
# Cool Ideas Mod has switched to Architectury, a toolchain aimed to ease developing multiplatform mods. [go here](https://github.com/MyNameTsThad/CoolIdeasMod-Architectury).
Cool Ideas that I have, had, and will have all combined into one mod.

This mod will branch into some other mods, If I have some features I believe are good enough to be published.

This mod will also feature versions for 1.18.2 and 1.19, both **Forge** and **Fabric**.

This current branch is for `Fabric 1.19`.

## IGNORE IF YOU DID NOT COME FROM AN IN GAME CHAT MESSAGE
If you see this message apon joining a server:

That means your client is missing the mod or using an older version.

Download the version the server uses from https://github.com/MyNameTsThad/CoolIdeasMod/releases
(make sure you pick the right version, the `versionid` part at the end can tell you what version to download)
